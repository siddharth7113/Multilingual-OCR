# Multilingual OCR Conversion

![OCR Conversion](ocr_1.png)

## Introduction

This project provides a user-friendly interface for performing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on multilingual documents. It allows users to upload documents in different formats such as PDF, DOCX, PNG, JPG, and JPEG, and extract text in multiple languages, including English, Hindi, and multilingual. Additionally, it includes basic search and advanced QA search functionalities for finding specific information within the extracted text.

## Features

- **Document Upload**: Supports PDF, DOCX, PNG, JPG, and JPEG formats for upload.
- **Multilingual OCR**: Extracts text from images or document formats in multiple languages, including English and Hindi.
- **Search Functionality**:
  - **Basic Search**: Search for specific words/phrases in the extracted text.
  - **Advanced QA Search**: Ask questions about the document, and the model retrieves relevant information.
- **Download Options**: Allows the user to download the extracted text in plain-text or JSON formats.
- **Clear Functionality**: A convenient button to clear the current session and start with a new document.

## Hardware Used

Inference for this project is being executed on **NVIDIA L40S with 48GB VRAM**, ensuring fast and efficient text extraction and search capabilities for large multilingual documents. The large memory capacity of the L40S allows the model to handle large document processing and complex queries seamlessly.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/multilingual-ocr.git
   cd multilingual-ocr
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv ocr_env
   source ocr_env/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Run

To run the Streamlit app, follow these steps:

1. **Activate your environment**:
   If you created a virtual environment, activate it:
   ```bash
   source ocr_env/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. **Access the App**:
   Open your browser and go to the provided URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`).
